# Egyptian stocks prediction
An innovative stock market prediction project that utilizes domain expertise and machine learning algorithms like LGBM to forecast stock returns as positive or negative. The project involves data scraping, extensive feature engineering, and market comparisons to provide actionable investment recommendations.

This project presents an innovative approach to predicting stock market returns by combining domain expertise with machine learning algorithms, primarily leveraging LightGBM (LGBM). The goal is to predict whether stock returns will be positive or negative, offering valuable insights for investment decisions.

The project follows a structured pipeline, starting with web scraping to collect stock data, followed by extensive feature engineering and technical analysis. It incorporates key financial indicators such as gold prices, USD exchange rates, and other relevant market factors to enhance predictive accuracy.

A detailed Python notebook walks through the entire process, from data acquisition to feature extraction and model training, ultimately providing recommendations on whether to invest in a stock for potential positive returns.

While the full methodology is not disclosed, the project demonstrates a unique and effective approach to stock market prediction, balancing experience-based insights with algorithmic assistance.
